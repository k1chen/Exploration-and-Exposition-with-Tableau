      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>
        Note: I ran into an error when embedding the Tableau story, so
        <strong>please scroll all the way to the left</strong> to make sure that you are viewing
        from the intended first tab. I apologize for the inconvenience, I tried
        reimporting the story and changing how the story was imported but
        nothing worked.

      <p>
        For the Exploration and Exposition with Tableau project, I chose to
        explore the EdConnect 2023 Household Survey Results dataset. This
        dataset contained a plethora of information, but something that I wanted
        to explore further was the effect of a child’s race on a household’s
        perception on digital devices. My hypothesis prior to delving deeper
        into the data was that there would be an effect because of inherent
        cultural differences between all-white families and families of color.
        This is based upon my experience as a person of color as well as
        conversations with friends who come from both sides of the categories —
        all white or families of color. I created a set of 7 questions under 3
        topics to organize the datasets: one introductory question to describe
        the 2 categories of households, 2 questions under the topic of Digital
        Device Usage Patterns and Learning, 2 questions under the topic of
        Parent-School Interaction through Digital Devices and 2 questions under
        the topic of Household Digital Device Perception. These questions served
        as a guiding point in creating the visualizations necessary for this
        project.

      <h2>Organization of Data and an Important Note</h2>
      <p>
        From original table, I used Tableau to move the questions from the
        columns label to rows and exported/saved the data to an Excel sheet. I
        reimported this sheet into Tableau as an updated data source. From
        there, I linked the updated sheet with labels: one for labels for
        answers and the other for labels for questions, as the labels.csv file
        that was given combined the answers and questions together. Using
        Tableau’s relationship line and filter functions, I was able to obtain
        the result to create my preliminary sheets for data concerning the total
        household numbers. For the specific BIPOC versus All-White
        categorizations, I used Excel pivot tables to calculate the numbers for
        each question/question option. Based on the data from the pivot tables,
        I created another Excel sheet and manually inputted the pivot data in
        order to achieve a data source to import into Tableau that could
        ultimately be used to create my final graphs comparing the BIPOC and
        All-White category data.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, in the process of creating pivot tables, I noticed that my
        numbers did not 100% match the reference graphs that were made available
        on the
        <a href="https://edconnect.bc.edu/#/dashboard/household" target="_blank"
          >EdConnect Household Survey dashboard</a
        >, particularly the BIPOC vs All-White numbers — what I was interested
        in. My numbers were slightly off, so I dug into the original CSV file
        provided by Professor Kim and noticed that some of the IDs had an empty
        value for the BIPOC category. An example of this was ID 596, which had a
        value for every category except the BIPOC column. Due to the fact that
        the BIPOC categorization was based on a “True/False” system, in which
        the only 2 possible results could have been BIPOC or All-White, it was
        quite confusing as to why there were some empty values. It seems as if
        the
        <a href="https://edconnect.bc.edu/#/dashboard/household" target="_blank"
          >EdConnect dashboard</a
        >
        counted these empty values into the “All White” category, resulting in
        numbers different from mine. However, I wanted my charts to accurately
        reflect the dataset that was given to me, so I decided to keep my data
        different from the given dashboard.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section class="analysis-part-2">
      <h2>Reflection</h2>
      <p>
        I used a combination of 4 different types of visualizations to create my
        story. First, I used a pie chart to represent the 2 different types of
        households being analyzed: an All-White household and a household with
        at least 1 BIPOC child. I chose a pie graph because of its simplicity as
        it makes very clear to a viewer the exact numbers and percentages of
        each category being analyzed. For the visualization concerning the
        household totals regarding the topics of Digital Device Usage Patterns
        and Household Digital Device Perception, I used a normal bar chart. The
        bar chart was a clear choice for these visualizations because it allows
        for viewers to clearly see the choices and their respective numbers for
        each question asked in part 1 of the survey. To display the total
        household figures for the topic of Parent-School Interaction through
        Digital Devices, I chose to use a highlight table because of its
        effectiveness in conveying a message of a strong trends using colors.
        It’s very clear at first glance that households sway significantly
        towards the side of using digital devices several times to access school
        information just purely by looking at the colors before the numbers.
        Lastly, I used stack bar charts for all of the comparisons between BIPOC
        and All-White households because it was the best way to have a viewer
        understand the ratios of each survey response between the two groups. By
        stacking the bar chart, viewers can clearly see whether or not there is
        a significant difference in number/percentage between BIPOC and
        All-White households in the selection choices in each of the survey
        questions. I also added annotations to further assist viewers in
        immediately understanding the percentages for each bar graph and what
        they represented.
      </p>
      <p>
        In testing my original hypothesis, I looked at the data assuming that if
        race has a no effect or a minimal effect on household, the data should
        follow the same pattern as displayed in the pie chart; for each choice
        in the survey, there should be about a 64/36 percent split between BIPOC
        and All-White households since that’s the same ratio as the total number
        of BIPOC/All-White households. It became quickly clear that there seemed
        to be a trend that BIPOC families tended to stray away from technology,
        as there was a greater percentage of BIPOC families voting “Never,”
        “Strongly disagree,” or “Disagree” than the percentage that they made of
        the total household number. For example, this can be seen in the final
        visualization, concerning whether or not households saw that technology
        would be important in the future, where BIPOC households made up 80% of
        the “strongly disagree” category and 88% of the “somewhat disagree.”
        However, it is very important to note that although these numbers may
        show some correlation, there are definitely a lot more factors to
        consider in addition to race. The survey included other household
        characteristics such as the genders of the child(ren) in the household,
        whether or not the household qualified for financial aid in school
        purchases, and many others. All of these other factors definitely impact
        a household’s perception and usage of digital devices and technology,
        but my visualization project was purely meant to serve as a guideline to
        understanding how race also plays a role in these household perceptions.
